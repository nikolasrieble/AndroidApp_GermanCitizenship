# AndroidApp_GermanCitizenship

Motivation:

I want to create an app that enables users to practice for the German Citizenship test. 
Therefore the following needs to be done:

- scrape exisiting questions from the web (https://www.einbuergerungstest-online.eu/)
- create a database to store the questions and answers 
- implement an android app that lets the user:
  - read questions and answers
  - choose multiple answers 
  - see the correct answer 
  - get a score per answer
