AndroidApp_GermanCitizenship

The currently available app in the PlayStore that enables a user to prepare himself for the German Citizenship Questionaire does not only contain a lot of ADs but also forces you to start from zero. 

In this project I will:

- scrape a website to get all current questions and answer
- build a database that stores the questions, answers, images and the learning progress
- setup an android application for user interaction

If you have any idea how to do something better or have general feedback, I am curious to hear about it.
